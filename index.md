# Preface

The colors are heavily inspired by [Oliver Byrne's version of the Elements](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/Euclid/byrne.html) (the colors themselves are a direct ripoff, but I've used them in different ways). I've also made use of [Richard Fitzpatrick's translation of the Elements](http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/euclid.html), as well as [D.E. Joyce's site on the Elements](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/bookI.html), which is, of course, the original web adaptation of Euclid. [Proof Wiki's presentation](http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/ProofWiki:Books/Euclid/The_Elements) has been useful as well.

# Introduction

Some wise words go here. 2000 year old book. blah blah.

# Book 1
## Definitions
## Postulates
### Postulate 1
A line segment can be drawn between any two points.

### Postulate 2
Any line segment can be extended arbitrarily.

### Postulate 3
Given a point A and another point B, a circle can be drawn with center at point A and with radius equal to the segment between A and B.

### Postulate 4
All right angles are equal to one another.

### Postulate 5
## Common Notions
## Propositions
### Proposition 1
Given a straight line segment, we can construct an equilateral triangle on that segment.

<div id="Rprop1" class="raph_container"></div>

Euclid doesn't really prove that the two circles must intersect, he basically assumes it. You need to add additional postulates to cover this.


### Proposition 2
Given a line segment and a point, we can construct a line segment of equal length to the original segment at the point.

<div id="Rprop2" class="raph_container"></div>
