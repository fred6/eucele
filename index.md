# Preface

The colors are heavily inspired by [Oliver Byrne's version of the Elements](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/Euclid/byrne.html) (the colors themselves are a direct ripoff, but I've used them in different ways). I've also made use of [Richard Fitzpatrick's translation of the Elements](http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/euclid.html), as well as [D.E. Joyce's site on the Elements](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/bookI.html), which is, of course, the original web adaptation of Euclid. [Proof Wiki's presentation](http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/ProofWiki:Books/Euclid/The_Elements) has been useful as well.
