 - name points globally. it's very confusing when you reference the points of every segment by "A" and "B" depending on which is left-most. points should have a unique name in a figure
 - use backbone instead of jquery spaghetti code
 - fix book 1 prop 2, step 1 error (it gets masked by EleGroup in step 2. the solution might be to individually assign the visibility step to each element in a Group. this seems really ugly though. I need to rethink the correct way to model this proof)
